# You Mean Bitcoin

This Chrome extension uses regex to replace any mention of "block chain technology" with "Bitcoin," THE block chain technology.

1. Git clone or download the zip and extract into a folder.
2. In `chrome://extensions/`, click "Load unpacked extension..." and find the folder from 1.
3. Have a sigh of relief.

Note: If you happen to want to see the actual words, you will need to disable the extension and reload the page.
