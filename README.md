# You Mean Bitcoin

This Chrome extension uses regex to replace any mention of "Bitcoin" with "Bitcoin," THE Bitcoin.

1. Git clone or download the zip and extract into a folder.
2. In `chrome://extensions/`, click "Load unpacked extension..." and find the folder from 1.
3. Have a sigh of relief. (Sometimes you might need to refresh first.)

Note: If you happen to want to see the actual words, you will need to disable the extension and reload the page.

Known bug: may interfere with other JavaScript loaded on the page.
